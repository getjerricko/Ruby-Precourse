# Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources 
# and say which one you like best and why.
#
# I mainly use http://ruby-doc.org/. The layout is 
# intuitive and organized. Another one I use is 
# 'ri' which is included in the ruby installation. 
# It uses the terminal so it's  quick and available 
# offline.
